abstract = {Whether the nervous system relies on modularity to simplify acquisition and control of complex motor skills remains controversial. To date, evidence for modularity has been indirect, based on statistical regularities in the motor commands captured by muscle synergies. Here we provide direct evidence by testing the prediction that in a truly modular controller it must be harder to adapt to perturbations that are incompatible with the modules. We investigated a reaching task in which human subjects used myoelectric control to move a mass in a virtual environment. In this environment we could perturb the normal muscle-to-force mapping, as in a complex surgical rearrangement of the tendons, by altering the mapping between recorded muscle activity and simulated force applied on the mass. After identifying muscle synergies, we performed two types of virtual surgeries. After compatible virtual surgeries, a full range of movements could still be achieved recombining the synergies, whereas after incompatible virtual surgeries, new or modified synergies would be required. Adaptation rates after the two types of surgery were compared. If synergies were only a parsimonious description of the regularities in the muscle patterns generated by a nonmodular controller, we would expect adaptation rates to be similar, as both types of surgeries could be compensated with similar changes in the muscle patterns. In contrast, as predicted by modularity, we found strikingly faster adaptation after compatible surgeries than after incompatible ones. These results indicate that muscle synergies are key elements of a modular architecture underlying motor control and adaptation.},

abstract = {A central issue in motor control is how the central nervous system generates the muscle activity patterns necessary to achieve a variety of behavioral goals. The many degrees of freedom of the musculoskeletal apparatus provide great flexibility but make the control problem extremely complex. Muscle synergies--coherent activations, in space or time, of a group of muscles--have been proposed as building blocks that could simplify the construction of motor behaviors. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a new method to extract invariant spatiotemporal components from the simultaneous recordings of the activity of many muscles. We used this technique to analyze the muscle patterns of intact and unrestrained frogs during kicking, a natural defensive behavior. Here we show that combinations of three time-varying muscle synergies underlie the variety of muscle patterns required to kick in different directions, that the recruitment of these synergies is related to movement kinematics, and that there are similarities among the synergies extracted from different behaviors.},

abstract = {When sharing load among multiple muscles, humans appear to select an optimal pattern of activation that minimizes costs such as the effort or variability of movement. How the nervous system achieves this behavior, however, is unknown. Here we show that contrary to predictions from optimal control theory, habitual muscle activation patterns are surprisingly robust to changes in limb biomechanics. We first developed a method to simulate joint forces in real time from electromyographic recordings of the wrist muscles. When the model was altered to simulate the effects of paralyzing a muscle, the subjects simply increased the recruitment of all muscles to accomplish the task, rather than recruiting only the useful muscles. When the model was altered to make the force output of one muscle unusually noisy, the subjects again persisted in recruiting all muscles rather than eliminating the noisy one. Such habitual coordination patterns were also unaffected by real modifications of biomechanics produced by selectively damaging a muscle without affecting sensory feedback. Subjects naturally use different patterns of muscle contraction to produce the same forces in different pronation-supination postures, but when the simulation was based on a posture different from the actual posture, the recruitment patterns tended to agree with the actual rather than the simulated posture. The results appear inconsistent with computation of motor programs by an optimal controller in the brain. Rather, the brain may learn and recall command programs that result in muscle coordination patterns generated by lower sensorimotor circuitry that are functionally "good-enough."},

J Neurophysiol 94: 4362â€“ 4372, 2005. First published September 7, 2005; doi:10.1152/jn.00380.2005. The issue of how the Euclidean properties of space are represented in the nervous system is a main focus in the study of visual perception, but is equally relevant to motor learning. The goal of our experiments was to investigate how the properties of space guide the remapping of motor coordination. Subjects wore an instrumented data glove that recorded the finger motions. Signals generated by the glove operated a remotely controlled endpoint: a cursor on a computer monitor. The subjects were instructed to execute movements of this endpoint with controlled motions of the fingers. This required inverting a highly redundant map from fingers to cursor motions. We found that 1) after training with visual feedback of the final error (but not of the ongoing cursor motion), subjects learned to map cursor locations into config-urations of the fingers; 2) extended practice of movement led to more rectilinear cursor movement, a trend facilitated by training under continuous visual feedback of cursor motions; 3) with practice, subjects reduced motion in the degrees of freedom that did not contribute to the movements of the cursor; 4) with practice, subjects reduced variability of both cursor and hand movements; and 5) the reduction of errors and the increase in linearity generalized beyond the set of movements used for training. These findings suggest that subjects not only learned to produce novel coordinated movement to control the placement of the cursor, but they also developed a representation of the Euclidean space on which hand movements were remapped. I N T R O D U C T I O N The defining property of Euclidean spaces is that the length of a segment does not depend on the segment's orientation or position. This property is essential to capture the nature and motions of rigid bodies (Goldstein 1980), which are defined by the invariance of the distances between their points. The measure of distance (the metric) is of vital importance in constructing a map between the visual representation of space and the motor commands controlling movements within that space. The ability of the visual system to capture the Euclidean nature of space has been extensively studied (Hatfield 2003; Shepard 2001), whereas fewer studies have examined the representation of space in the motor system (Bernstein 1967; Rossetti 1998). These studies emphasize that visual perception and motor action are independent but highly interconnected. The visual representation of space from retinal coordinates is believed to be transformed into motor commands by dorsal pathways, whereas objects within space are thought to be represented by ventral pathways, with multiple interconnec-tions between the two pathways (Goodale and Milner 1992; Milner and Goodale 1993). In contrast, little is known about how the fundamental geometrical properties of space are rep-resented by the motor system. We easily formulate and execute motor plans such as " move the hand 10 cm to the right, " despite the fact that this action requires widely varying muscle activations and segmental coordination, depending on the hand's initial position. This clearly demonstrates that the motor system is able to capture the Euclidean properties of the space in which actions take place. The purpose of our studies was to understand how the motor system learns to represent a new space. We asked subjects to move between target locations on a computer screen using an instrumented data glove that converted finger motions into cursor motions. The screen had a well-defined Euclidean met-ric: the distance between any two points is the length of the straight segment that joins them. In contrast, there is no obvious or " natural " definition of distance in finger articulation space (i.e., between two gestures of the hand). We observed how two features of motor behavior evolved in the course of learning this novel task: 1) the shape of the cursor trajectories and 2) the variability of both hand and cursor motions. Our hypotheses centered on two questions. First, we asked whether subjects learn the Euclidean metric of the controlled endpoint by organizing coordination of finger motions to gen-erate straighter motions of the cursor (i.e., movements of minimum Euclidean length). The second question is whether practice leads to more accurate targeting, at the expense of more variable trajectories (Todorov and Jordan 2002) or, alternatively, does the entire movement profile become less variable, suggesting that the control system is attempting to become both more accurate in reaching the target and more consistent in producing finger and/or cursor trajectories (Flash and Hogan 1985; Hogan 1984)? We will show that when subjects learn to control an overabundant set of hand signals in the presence of a novel transformation between these signals and the controlled endpoint, they become both more accurate in the task and more consistent in their finger and cursor motions. This finding is not consistent with the model of motor control proposing that the motor system increases variability in the redundant degrees of freedom to improve accuracy of the motor task.},

We found that M1 has 2 subdivisions. A rostral region lacks CM cells and represents an "old" M1 that is the standard for many mammals. The descending commands mediated by corticospinal efferents from old M1 must use the integrative mechanisms of the spinal cord to generate motoneuron activity and motor output. In contrast, a caudal region of M1 contains shoulder, elbow, and finger CM cells. This region represents a "new" M1 that is present only in some higher primates and humans. The direct access to motoneurons afforded by CM cells enables the newly recognized M1 to bypass spinal cord mechanisms and sculpt novel patterns of motor output that are essential for highly skilled movements.},

In this review, we describe the evolution of the modern concept using studies of kinematic and force synergies in human hand control, neurophysiology of cortical and spinal neurons, and electromyographic (EMG) activity of hand muscles. We go beyond the often purely descriptive usage of synergy by reviewing the organization of the underlying neuronal circuitry in order to propose mechanistic explanations for various observed synergy phenomena.

The complex biomechanical and neural architecture of the hand poses challenging questions for understanding the control strategies that underlie the coordination of finger movements and forces required for a wide variety of behavioral tasks, ranging from multidigit grasping to the individuated movements of single digits. Hence, a number of experimental approaches, from studies of finger movement kinematics to the recording of electromyographic and cortical activities, have been used to extend our knowledge of neural control of the hand. Experimental evidence indicates that the simultaneous motion and force of the fingers are characterized by coordination patterns that reduce the number of independent degrees of freedom to be controlled. Peripheral and central constraints in the neuromuscular apparatus have been identified that may in part underlie these coordination patterns, simplifying the control of multi-digit grasping while placing certain limitations on individuation of finger movements. We review this evidence, with a particular emphasis on how these constraints extend through the neuromuscular system from the behavioral aspects of finger movements and forces to the control of the hand from the motor cortex.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. Grasping is a highly complex movement that requires the coordination of multiple hand joints and muscles. Muscle synergies have been proposed to be the functional building blocks that coordinate such complex motor behaviors, but little is known about how they are implemented in the central nervous system. Here we demonstrate that premotor interneurons (PreM-INs) in the primate cervical spinal cord underlie the spatiotemporal patterns of hand muscle synergies during a voluntary grasping task. Using spike-triggered averaging of hand muscle activity, we found that the muscle fields of PreM-INs were not uniformly distributed across hand muscles but rather distributed as clusters corresponding to muscle synergies. Moreover, although individual PreM-INs have divergent activation patterns, the population activity of PreM-INs reflects the temporal activation of muscle synergies. These findings demonstrate that spinal PreM-INs underlie the muscle coordination required for voluntary hand movements in primates. Given the evolution of neural control of primate hand functions, we suggest that spinal premotor circuits provide the fundamental coordination of multiple joints and muscles upon which more fractionated control is achieved by superimposed, phylogenetically newer, pathways.},

This makes it possible to reformulate the optimal control problem in terms of the augmented dynamics, and optimize a high-level feedback controller without running into the curse of dimensionality. The resulting control hierarchy compares favorably to existing methods in robotics. Furthermore we demonstrate a number of similarities to (non-hierarchical) optimal feedback control. Besides its engineering applications, the new framework addresses a key unresolved problem in the neural control of movement. It has long been hypothesized that coordination involves selective control of task parameters via muscle synergies, but the link between these parameters and the synergies capable of controlling them has remained elusive.

abstract = {Numerous observations of structured motor variability indicate that the sensorimotor system preferentially controls task-relevant parameters while allowing task-irrelevant ones to fluctuate. Optimality models show that controlling a redundant musculo-skeletal system in this manner meets task demands while minimizing control effort. Although this line of inquiry has been very productive, the data are mostly behavioral with no direct physiological evidence on the level of muscle or neural activity. Furthermore, biomechanical coupling, signal-dependent noise, and alternative causes of trial-to-trial variability confound behavioral studies. Here we address those confounds and present evidence that the nervous system preferentially controls task-relevant parameters on the muscle level. We asked subjects to produce vertical fingertip force vectors of prescribed constant or time-varying magnitudes while maintaining a constant finger posture. We recorded intramuscular electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously from all seven index finger muscles during this task. The experiment design and selective fine-wire muscle recordings allowed us to account for a median of 91{\%} of the variance of fingertip forces given the EMG signals. By analyzing muscle coordination in the seven-dimensional EMG signal space, we find that variance-per-dimension is consistently smaller in the task-relevant subspace than in the task-irrelevant subspace. This first direct physiological evidence on the muscle level for preferential control of task-relevant parameters strongly suggest the use of a neural control strategy compatible with the principle of minimal intervention. Additionally, variance is nonnegligible in all seven dimensions, which is at odds with the view that muscle activation patterns are composed from a small number of synergies.},
